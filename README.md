# Getting started with Gnoga

## Introduction

This document in French has been written by Théodore Gigault, as part of his internship in the Sowebio SARL company, in order to conclude his first year at ENSEIRB-MATMECA, engineering school of Bordeaux.

The purpose of his internship was to discover the methods of modular and structured programming, object-oriented, as well as a method of top-down analysis, then to put into practice the learnings with the handling of a graphic software infrastructure in Ada and, finally, to carry out the analysis of the application of management of the contracts customers in SEPA direct debits of the Sowebio SARL company.

In order to implement this application, GNOGA was chosen as the web framework.
